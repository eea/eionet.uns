<h1><a name="_Toc117662252"></a>1. General Principles</h1>
<p>The Unified Notification Service (UNS) is part of the EEA REPORTNET system. The purpose of UNS is to improve the cooperation and transparency as well as ease the retrieval of information from REPORTNET. This is accomplished by UNS, a notification system, which is independent of specific data providers.</p>
<p>UNS defines some terms to describe the functionality of the application. The following terms are very common:</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc117662253"></a>XML</h2>
<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) was designed to provide a means for information to be served, received, and processed on the Web in the way that is now possible with HTML.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc117662254"></a>RSS</h2>
<p>RSS is an acronym for Rich Site Summary (or Really Simple Syndication), an XML format for distributing news headlines on the Web, also known as syndication.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc117662255"></a>RDF</h2>
<p>Resource Description Framework is a formal data model from the W3C using XML for the description of web resources using machine-readable metadata.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc117662256"></a>REPORTNET Web Dashboards</h2>
<p>The Web Dashboards Service is part of the EEA REPORTNET architecture. It provides key stakeholders in international environmental reporting with dashboards presenting summary information harvested from REPORTNET modules, as well as from other Agency systems based on predefined profiles. Each registered REPORTNET user may define own dashboard profile allowing him/her viewing of desired REPORTNET information at dashboard web page. URL of that page is REPORTNET userâ€™s WDB address.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc117662257"></a>User roles</h2>
<p>Roles are named groups of related privileges that REPORTNET Unified Notification Service grant to users or other roles. Access to the REPORTNET Unified Notification Service will be granted at 4 levels of users:</p>
<ol>
	<li>UNS Administrator: Is a registered user who is allowed to perform the UNS administrative operations. This user also may include privileges of the UNS User.</li>
	<li>UNS User: Is a registered user who is able to manages own subscriptions in the UNS.</li>
	<li>UNS RPC User: Is registered user who can access the UNS programmatically in order to create new PUSH channels or the push RDF formed data. This user is also able to see own PUSH channels by using the UNS user interface as well to create new one.</li>
	<li>Anonymous User: Is an unregistered user who is only able to see the <a href="auth.html">UNS welcome page</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc117662258"></a>Content Channels</h2>
<p>Content channels are used for harvesting event content data. There are two types of channels. PULL and PUSH channels. Pull Channels are external web applications from which UNS is pulling data, whereas PUSH Channels are used by external web applications to send events data to the UNS. REPORTNET users will be able to subscribe themselves to these channels and receive notifications for any new events. </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc117662259"></a>Subscription to a Content Channel</h2>
<p>A REPORTNET user is able to subscribe to a channel, for receiving notifications that are allowed to his/her role. </p>
